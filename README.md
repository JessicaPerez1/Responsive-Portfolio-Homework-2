# Responsive Portfolio

Responsive design ensures that web applications render well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes. As a developer, you will likely be asked to create a mobile-first application or add responsive design to an existing application.

## Purpose of this project

First, you will use the Bootstrap CSS Framework to create a mobile responsive portfolio. How do you deliver this? Here are some guidelines:

- Create the following files files: `index.html`, `portfolio.html` and `contact.html`.

- Using Bootstrap, develop your portfolio site with the following items:

  - A navbar

  - A responsive layout

  - Responsive images

### What I did

- Used Bootstrap's grid system and components

- Built responsive web pages to properly display on mobile as well as larger screen formats

### Minimum Requirements

- Functional, deployed application

- Navbar on each page must contain working links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

- Used semantic html.

- My personalized information is shared through these pages

### Bonus

- Using Bootstrap, make a sticky footer and use sub-rows and sub-columns on your portfolio site (**Hint:** Check out the Bootstrap documentation).
